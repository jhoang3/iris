# 2nd project to learn about classification - Iris Flowers
This project involves analyzing a dataset on species of Iris flowers. The goal of this project is to train accurate machine learning models to best classify what a given flower is based on its sepal and petal length/width.

After visually analyzing the pairplot and univariate statistics with the provided features, we see that the sestosa species typically has the shortest sepal length, petal length and width, followed by the versicolor species, then virginica.

To get an understanding of the usage of ML models, I've depicted a support vector machine based on 2 features, sepal length and width as arbitary features. 

Afterwards, a variety of ML models will be trained and tested with the entire set of features. Each model will be evaluated, tuned, then evaluated again to get an understanding of what changed and how exactly that impacted the metrics that will be later interpreted.
