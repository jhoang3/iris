# 2nd project to learn about classification - Iris Flowers
This project involves analyzing a dataset on species of Iris flowers. The goal of this project is to train accurate machine learning models to best classify what a given flower is based on its sepal and petal length/width.

After visually analyzing the pairplot and univariate statistics with the provided features, we see that the sestosa species typically has the shortest sepal length, petal length and width, followed by the versicolor species, then virginica.
